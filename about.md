# About me

Hi, my name is Max. I'm a software develeper from Germany. I've been programming since I was about 11 years old, and have accumulated 7 years of professional experience as well. I'm mostly around and about the .NET ecosystem, but I also like exploring the node.js universe.

I play video games in my spare time. My favourites so far are Rocket League and Sea of Thieves. I generally don't enjoy single-players games as much, especially RPGs. Some ACC sim-racing is also in my mix.

Sometimes I produce YouTube videos. My channel started with scripting tutorials for the Minecraft mod "Computer Craft", which utilizes Lua. From that period I also still know a lot about it. Since then I also made some commented gameplay videos for various games, and some .NET coding in streams as well as some tutorials. I haven't been that active recently though.
