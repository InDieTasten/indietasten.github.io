2:T44c,<p>Everyone these days has heard of semver,
as most package managers try to enforce it upon their packages.</p>
<p>While the idea behind it is nobel, the execution often lacks.</p>
<p>We've all been screwed by some form of <a href="http://sentimentalversioning.org/">sentimental versioning</a>
before I'm sure, so here's an idea you might not have heard of:</p>
<h2>Conventional Commits</h2>
<p>Use ✨<a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/">conventional commits</a>✨,
introduce some tooling, and you'll be semantically versioning in no time.</p>
<p>Commit messages are subject to rules according to a specification which ensures, that the git history can be tracked for patch, minor and major changes.</p>
<p>As a bonus, you can from now on generate your CHANGELOG.md as well.</p>
<p>Thanks for adhering to my advice.</p>

<p>Are you already comitting conventionally? How is it working out for you? Was it hard to adapt with an entire team?</p>
