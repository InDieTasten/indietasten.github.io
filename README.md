Welcome to my personal homepage WIP

I plan to create a zero-backend SPL blog and project pages on this, as there is no server language the github pages allow.

So stay tuned and check it at a later point.

The homepage will include a blog for me to post some funny things I come across while designing games and application as well as presentation pages of such games and applications.

For example my game 'EXP - Expanded Exploration'
Or another project that generates planets including flora and atmospheres.

Have fun and enjoy coding!
