# Welcome to my personal Homepage

Those are the projects that I completed, am currently working on, and those, who I want to pursue in the future:

- Games / Applications / Libraries
    - ~~Electron Jump - Doodle Jump clone using SFML~~
    - ~~Connect4 - Connect4 clone with local and remote multiplayer using SFML~~
    - ~~indie-classes - Lightweight classes for Lua~~
    - **indie-ml - Neural network and NEAT algorithm implementation for Lua**
    - Top Down Heist - A 2D payday2 stealth clone (coop)
    - LOC - Idle game inspired by Cookie Clicker and Paperclips
    - CC-C# - C# Build tools to write CC programs in C#
- Machine Learning
    - **XOR - Simple NEAT implementation to create an XOR agent**
    - Pole-Balancing - Simple NEAT implementation to create a pole-balancing agent
    - Intelligent City Traffic Control

_Apart from those "childish" projects I do in my free time, I'm also professionally working full-time in projects executed by my employer. These are mostly cloud-based distributed web applications utilizing Microsofts hardware and software stack, such as Azure and ASP.NET, SQL Server, etc._

To frame the scope of my experience so far, here is a list of languages, frameworks and platforms I touched in the past, am actively using and those, who I want to get in touch with in the future:

- ~~QB~~
- **LÃ¶ve2D / Lua**
- ~~Angular 1~~
- ~~C++~~
- **HTML**
- **CSS/SASS**
- **C#/.NET (Core)**
- **ASP.NET (Core) MVC**
- **JavaScript/ECMAScript v6**
- **TypeScript**
- **Microsoft Azure Web Apps**
- **Microsoft Azure SQL**
- **Microsoft Azure Blob Storage**
- **ASP.NET Core**
- **Docker**
- **Docker Swarm**
- Service Fabric
- Angular 4

While this page has been about software development at the coding scale, I have also gotton in touch with designing scalable, highly available and business critical architectures. This is something I'm really passionate about and I'm happy, that my current employment enables me to seamlessly jump between developer and architect role.
