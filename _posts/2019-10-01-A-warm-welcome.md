Hi there! Welcome to my blog. I'm Max. I am a full-stack web developer based in Germany.

This is my personal blog, where I write about interesting topics I run
across during my work or on my side projects.

Feel free to take a look around my page. You might find something interesting here and there.
Of course, I have lots of work ahead of me to fill this page with a reasonable amount of information.

## Discussion

For questions or comments, [here's](https://github.com/InDieTasten/indietasten.github.io/issues/19) a GitHub thread for this post.

Wish me luck,
~InDieTasten
