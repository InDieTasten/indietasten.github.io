I have a dream about conventional commits
=========================================

Everyone these days has heard of semver,
as most package managers try to enforce it upon their packages.

While the idea behind it is nobel, the execution often lacks.

We've all been screwed by some form of [sentimental versioning](http://sentimentalversioning.org/)
before I'm sure, so here's an idea you might not have heard of:

Conventional Commits
--------------------

Use ✨[conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)✨,
introduce some tooling, and you'll be semantically versioning in no time.

Commit messages are subject to rules according to a specification which ensures, that the git history can be tracked for patch, minor and major changes.

As a bonus, you can from now on generate your CHANGELOG.md as well.

Thanks for adhering to my advice.

# Discussion

Are you already comitting conventionally? How is it working out for you? Was it hard to adapt with an entire team?
