### ✔ Slated Prime Sudoku solver

This brute-forces a specially formed type of sudoku also linked below.
That was like an hour wasted, and sadly, I wasn't first to solve it. But I was close.

It was supposed to be similar to HTML, and run Lua as a scripting language.

### ✔ Doodle Jump

I seem to have lost the code of that project.
I probably never pushed it to GitHub.
It might still be somewhere on an old drive on some old computer in the corner of my room.
But there's a YouTube Tutorial about it 🎉

### ✔ Connect4

A basic implementation of the infamous Connect4 game.
I think it turned out quite well for the amount of experience I had at the time.
I also made a Tutorial series about it

### ⚰ 2k16

This is a sad one. I started working on this at the 2016 new years eve at midnight.
I was streaming the development of this on YouTube with like 2 viewers, while getting drunk.
I promise I have friends though!
It's also another attempt of the EXP game from below.

## 2015

### ⚰ ccTCP

An attempt at re-implementing the TCP/IP stack layers 1 to 4 as an educational practice.
This was an effort of multiple people coming together from the ComputerCraft forums.
There were some technical disputes, which led me to leave the group.

## 2014

### ⚰ CodeX

This was an attempt to do some collaborative coding with my YouTube community, back when it was still a community.
I was apparently also the only one who actually did any work, but a lot of ideas came from the community.
It's a collection of programs for the Mineraft mod ComputerCraft. I was once quite known for being able to program for this mod quite well.

## ~2010
### ⚰ EXP

This is one of my first projects. It's a spaceship simulation type of game.
I started this well before using GitHub. I hosted my own TFS at home just for me and a friend.
It was a terrible experience.
