### âœ” TerminalRTX

A basic raytracing renderer that runs in the terminal. It's completely useless.
The entire 3 hours of the port are documented as a live coding session on YouTube.

### âœ” Cov-2-Queue

A questionaire for determining a priority classification for a test subject's sample.
This was designed, implemented and rolled out as part of the 48-hour #wirvsvirus hackathon.
The hackathon was the biggest in history by participant and submission count at the time.

### âš° breadstone

A blazor app for designing eletrical cirtcuits for minecraft, known as Redstone.

### âœ” indie-classes

No, I'm not the first to do this. Yes, this is probably copied together from other things.

### ðŸ›  b0tnet

A hacking game idea, that turned into a terminal playground for myself.
There are couple funny demoes in the tagged releases of some of those experiments.

### âœ” Slated Prime Sudoku solver

This brute-forces a specially formed type of sudoku also linked below.
That was like an hour wasted, and sadly, I wasn't first to solve it. But I was close.

It was supposed to be similar to HTML, and run Lua as a scripting language.

### âœ” Doodle Jump

I seem to have lost the code of that project.
I probably never pushed it to GitHub.
It might still be somewhere on an old drive on some old computer in the corner of my room.
But there's a YouTube Tutorial about it ðŸŽ‰

### âœ” Connect4

A basic implementation of the infamous Connect4 game.
I think it turned out quite well for the amount of experience I had at the time.
I also made a Tutorial series about it

### âš° 2k16

This is a sad one. I started working on this at the 2016 new years eve at midnight.
I was streaming the development of this on YouTube with like 2 viewers, while getting drunk.
I promise I have friends though!
It's also another attempt of the EXP game from below.

## 2015

### âš° ccTCP

An attempt at re-implementing the TCP/IP stack layers 1 to 4 as an educational practice.
This was an effort of multiple people coming together from the ComputerCraft forums.
There were some technical disputes, which led me to leave the group.

## 2014

### âš° CodeX

This was an attempt to do some collaborative coding with my YouTube community, back when it was still a community.
I was apparently also the only one who actually did any work, but a lot of ideas came from the community.
It's a collection of programs for the Mineraft mod ComputerCraft. I was once quite known for being able to program for this mod quite well.

### âš° EXP

This is one of my first projects. It's a spaceship simulation type of game.
I started this well before using GitHub. I hosted my own TFS at home just for me and a friend.
It was a terrible experience.
